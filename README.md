## Drinks Project

This project aims to introduce us to the world of software testing and test automation. Our first steps into this field will be made with Java and the Unit Testing framework JUnit 5.

The project in its core consists of Liquids and Drinks that are made up of those liquids. Whereas the template only contains a `SimpleDrink` class with a name and a single liquid, the additions made during this assignment add two further subclasses: `Cocktails` and `LongDrinks`. Each of which allow for liquids to be mixed under certain guidlines, which are elaborated in the respective sub chapters:

1. [Cocktails](#addition-1---cocktails)
2. [Long Drinks](#addition-2---long-drinks)

## Additions to the template

The following additions were made to the original Drinks Template in the process of carrying out this task.
The template can be found here: [Drinks Project Template][template].

### Addition 1 - Cocktails

Cocktail extends the class drink. The class should reflect a "real world" cocktail. Therefore it holds different Liquids in an ArrayList, which are 
needed for the basic function of a cocktail.  

Cocktail can:  
- Differ between cocktail-sizes.  
- Add new liquids.  
- Give information about the volume and alcohol-percentage of the finished cocktail.  
- Tell if non-alcoholic or alcoholic cocktail.

Cocktail-sizes:  
There are two sizes. Normal-size and party-size, which are 0,5l and 1,5l.  

### Addition 2 - Long Drinks

The class LongDrink is an additional subclass of the class drink. It contains two different liquids - one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic.
So a valid LongDrink cannot consist of two non-alcoholic liquids or two alcoholic liquids.
Beer cannot be mixed with a non-alcoholic liquid - but if it did, an exception with the message **Radler ist kein Alkohol** should be thrown.
On the other hand, it should be possible to add an alcoholic liquid to a beer - this is the only exception to the rule made above.

Here you can see a short code snippet, which uses the RadlerException:
```java
// Special case for beer: Beer can't be mixed with a non-alcoholic drink, but mixing
// beer with another alcoholic drink is allowed
if (alcohol.getName().toLowerCase().contains("bier")
        || alcohol.getName().toLowerCase().contains("beer"))
{
    if (alcohol.getAlcoholPercent() <= 0.0)
    {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                "Why the hell are you trying to use a non-alcoholic beer for a long drink?"
        );
    }

    if (nonAlcohol.getAlcoholPercent() <= 0.0)
    {
        throw new RadlerException("Radler ist kein Alkohol!");
    }
}
```
